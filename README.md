# UniChain: Decentralized Academic Credential Verification üéìüîó

UniChain is a **decentralized, blockchain-based platform** built on **StarkNet** that revolutionizes the way academic credentials are issued, stored, and verified. By leveraging **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and **tamper-proof blockchain technology**, UniChain eliminates academic fraud, ensures privacy, and provides instant verification for employers and institutions.

## üåü Why UniChain?  
Academic credential fraud is a growing problem, and traditional verification methods are slow, costly, and prone to errors. UniChain solves this by:  
- **Eliminating fraud** with blockchain-backed, tamper-proof degrees.  
- **Protecting privacy** using hashed identifiers and ZKPs.  
- **Enabling instant verification** for employers and institutions.  
- **Seamlessly integrating** with HR platforms, job portals, and university systems via APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

### 1. Degree Issuance by Universities  
   - Universities issue degrees through UniChain‚Äôs platform.  
   - Each degree is **digitally signed** and stored on the blockchain.  
   - Universities prove domain ownership using **ENS/DNS verification** to ensure authenticity.  

### 2. Secure Storage  
   - Degree metadata is stored on **StarkNet** for immutability.  
   - Large files (e.g., PDFs) are stored off-chain using **IPFS/Arweave**, linked to on-chain hashes.  

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Verification  
   - Employers and institutions can verify degrees in **real-time** without accessing sensitive student data.  
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** ensure privacy by allowing verification without exposing personal information.  

### 4. Seamless Integration  
   - UniChain provides **APIs** for easy integration with HR platforms, job portals, and university systems.
